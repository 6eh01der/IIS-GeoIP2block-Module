# IIS GeoIP2block Module

This is a modified version of the geoblock module originaly created by Triple IT for IIS 7/8.x. It can be added to any application pool using integrated pipeline mode running .Net 4 (now also on IIS 10). It uses the IPv4 address to determine the geographic location of the request by using Maxminds GeoIP2 database and takes action accordingly.
